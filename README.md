Java program with a graphical user interface (GUI) to  erase and display different shapes based on user input of specific commands. 
The single program must be created inside one and only one file with exactly this title – 
“Shapes.java” (without quotes) – and have the following functionality:
1. [Component 1] A graphical interactive component which has the following actions 
associated with it: the component can accept user input, where assuming the input is 
valid, a shape will be displayed on the main screen. It is assumed that the program will 
eventually support a large variety of shapes. The program should currently accept the 
following input: an integer between 5 and 8 inclusive. Depending on the input, the 
program should generate a shape with the number of sides corresponding to the input 
value. For example, an input of 7 should generate a shape with seven sides.
1.1. You need to ensure that the user input is validated, and feedback is given when an 
invalid input is entered. 
1.2. The program should only allow the user to enter one valid input at a time. 
1.3. The main screen should only display one active shape at a time.
1.4. The colour of the active shape should be red if the number of sides is even, and 
black if the number of sides is odd.
2. [Component 2] A graphical interactive component which has the following actions 
associated with it: the component must accept user input, where assuming the input is 
valid, the currently displayed shape will be manipulated depending on the validated 
input. It is assumed that the program will eventually support a large variety of 
rotations. The program should currently accept the following inputs: rotate the shape 
by 30 degrees, rotate the shape by 90 degrees and rotate the shape by minus 45 
degrees.
2.1. You need to ensure that the user input is validated, and feedback is given when an 
invalid input is entered. 
2.2. The program should only allow the user to enter one valid input at a time.
2.3. The main screen should only display one active shape at a time.
3. Any potential error states should not crash the program or generate generic error 
messages. The program should clearly indicate to the user that an error has occurred, 
with specific information on why the error occurred and what valid action(s) is/are 
available.
